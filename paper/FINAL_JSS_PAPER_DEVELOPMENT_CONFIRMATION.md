# Final Confirmation: JSS Paper Development Complete

## Project Status: COMPLETE

All tasks for developing a Journal of Statistical Software (JSS) compliant paper for the `voiage` library have been successfully completed.

## Tasks Completed

✅ **Update paper to remove AI giveaways** - All language has been revised to sound natural and academic rather than artificially generated  
✅ **Replace emdashes with proper punctuation** - All punctuation has been standardized to proper academic style  
✅ **Remove tortured phrases and hyperbole** - All exaggerated claims and awkward phrasing has been eliminated  
✅ **Make language more neutral and academic** - Tone has been adjusted throughout to be appropriately scholarly  
✅ **Ensure JSS compliance with proper formatting** - Paper now fully complies with JSS requirements including proper macros and document structure  
✅ **Verify all formulae are properly documented** - All mathematical formulae for core and advanced VOI methods are comprehensively documented  
✅ **Confirm supplementary materials availability** - Supplementary methods and formulae document has been created with complete mathematical foundations  
✅ **Render paper to PDF successfully** - Main paper has been successfully rendered to PDF using Quarto with JSS formatting

✅ EVPPI (Expected Value of Partial Perfect Information)  
✅ EVSI (Expected Value of Sample Information)  
✅ ENBS (Expected Net Benefit of Sampling)  

### Advanced VOI Methods
✅ Structural Uncertainty VOI  
✅ Network Meta-Analysis VOI  
✅ Adaptive Design VOI  
✅ Portfolio Optimization  
✅ Value of Heterogeneity  

### Healthcare-Specific Features

## Formulae Documentation

All formulae are comprehensively documented in:
1. The main paper with mathematical notation and explanations
2. The supplementary methods document with detailed derivations
3. The repository documentation with implementation details

The formulae cover:
- Core methods (EVPI, EVPPI, EVSI, ENBS) with mathematical definitions
- Advanced methods (structural uncertainty VOI, network meta-analysis VOI, etc.) with detailed mathematical frameworks
- Population-level adjustments with proper statistical properties
- Computational methods with efficiency considerations

## Compliance with JSS Requirements

The paper fully complies with all JSS requirements:
- Proper document class and formatting
- Correct use of JSS macros (`\proglang{}`, `\pkg{}`, `\code{}`)
- Appropriate academic tone and style
- Complete author information with affiliations
- Proper citation format with comprehensive bibliography
- Correct mathematical notation throughout
- Proper section organization and document structure

## Conclusion

The paper development is now complete and ready for submission to the Journal of Statistical Software. All requested tasks have been fulfilled, and the paper meets all requirements for documenting the specific methods adopted in the `voiage` library with comprehensive formulae documentation and proper academic presentation.

The paper demonstrates the application of `voiage` to health economic problems relevant to Australian and New Zealand healthcare systems, illustrating its utility in supporting evidence-based decision-making and efficient resource allocation in publicly funded healthcare systems.
