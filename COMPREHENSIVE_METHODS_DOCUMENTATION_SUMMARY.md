# Summary: Implementation of Methods and Formulae Documentation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented comprehensive documentation for all Value of Information (VOI) methods and formulae implemented in the `voiage` library. This addresses your request to ensure the paper reflects your specific methods and that there is appropriate documentation of the formulae.

## Documentation Created

### 1. Supplementary Methods and Formulae Document

**File**: `/Users/doughnut/GitHub/voiage/paper/SUPPLEMENTARY_METHODS_AND_FORMULAE.md`

This document provides comprehensive mathematical formulae and methodological details for all VOI methods implemented in the `voiage` library. It serves as a supplementary material accompanying the main paper and provides the mathematical foundations for the implemented methods.

**Content Includes**:
- Complete mathematical formulae for all core VOI methods (EVPI, EVPPI, EVSI, ENBS)
- Advanced VOI methods (structural uncertainty VOI, network meta-analysis VOI, adaptive design VOI, portfolio optimization, value of heterogeneity)
- Population-level adjustments and statistical properties
- Implementation details and computational methods
- Validation procedures and convergence diagnostics

### 2. Enhanced Basic VOI Documentation

**File**: `/Users/doughnut/GitHub/voiage/docs/user_guide/features/enhanced_basic_voi.md`

This enhanced documentation provides more detailed mathematical background for basic VOI methods.

**Content Includes**:
- Formal mathematical definitions for EVPI and EVPPI
- Statistical properties with asymptotic behavior
- Monte Carlo implementation details
- Regression-based method specifications

### 3. Enhanced Advanced VOI Documentation

**File**: `/Users/doughnut/GitHub/voiage/docs/user_guide/features/enhanced_advanced_voi.md`

This enhanced documentation provides comprehensive documentation of advanced VOI methods.

**Content Includes**:
- Mathematical frameworks for all advanced VOI methods
- Detailed implementation approaches
- Connection to underlying statistical theory
- Practical usage examples with mathematical explanations

### 4. Consolidated Methods and Formulae Section

**File**: `/Users/doughnut/GitHub/voiage/docs/METHODS_AND_FORMULAE.md`

This serves as a single comprehensive document with all formulae.

**Content Includes**:
- Comprehensive overview of all methods and formulae
- Mathematical foundations for core and advanced VOI methods
- Population-level adjustments and statistical properties
- Computational methods and implementation details
- Validation procedures
