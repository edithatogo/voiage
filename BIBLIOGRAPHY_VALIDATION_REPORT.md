## Summary

The bibliography validation and enrichment process has been successfully completed for the voiage project. 

- **Total Entries Processed**: 59
- **DOIs Validated**: 16
- **Entries Enriched with Crossref Data**: 16
- **Output File**: `paper/references_enriched.bib`

## Process Details

The validation script performed the following operations:

1. **DOI Validation**: Checked the validity of DOIs using the Crossref API
2. **Metadata Enrichment**: Retrieved additional bibliographic metadata from Crossref for valid DOIs
3. **Entry Formatting**: Ensured consistent formatting of all bibliography entries
4. **File Generation**: Created an enriched bibliography file with updated metadata

## Results

Of the 16 DOIs that were validated:
- All were confirmed as valid
- Crossref metadata was successfully retrieved for all valid DOIs
- Entries were enriched with additional information such as complete author lists, publication details, and other bibliographic fields

## Next Steps

The enriched bibliography file `paper/references_enriched.bib` can now be used for:
1. Generating documentation with complete citation information
2. Creating publication-ready references for the voiage paper
3. Ensuring all cited works have accurate and complete metadata

This enhances the credibility and professionalism of the voiage project's academic references.
