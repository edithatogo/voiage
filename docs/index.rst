Welcome to pyVOI's documentation!
===================================

**pyVOI** is a Python library for Value of Information (VOI) analysis.
VOI methods help quantify the economic value of acquiring additional
information to reduce uncertainty in decision-making, particularly in fields
like health economics, risk analysis, and decision sciences.

This library aims to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for calculating
various VOI metrics, including:

*   Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI)
*   Expected Value of Partial Perfect Information (EVPPI)
*   Expected Value of Sample Information (EVSI)
*   Expected Net Benefit of Sampling (ENBS)
*   And advanced VOI analyses for structural uncertainty, network meta-analysis,
    adaptive designs, research portfolios, sequential decisions, observational data,
    and model calibration.
