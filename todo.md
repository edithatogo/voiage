## Done

*   [x] Define polyglot tooling parity and observability plan.

*   [x] Implement dynamic-programming portfolio VOI optimization.
    *   Replaced the placeholder with memoized budget-constrained subset selection, optional dependency-group value discounting, and regression tests proving DP can outperform greedy selection.
*   [x] Implement Value of Heterogeneity.
    *   Added subgroup-specific decision value calculations, numeric subgroup binning, optimal subgroup identification, and subgroup plotting.
*   [x] Implement dominance analysis and plotting.
    *   Added strong dominance, extended dominance, frontier extraction, ICER helpers, and a cost-effectiveness plane plot.
*   [x] Implement Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Frontier (CEAF).
    *   Added CEAF calculation, plotting, uncertainty bands, and package export coverage.
*   [x] Add efficient and moment-based EVSI methods plus an EVSI CLI command.
    *   Added `evsi(..., method="efficient")`, `evsi(..., method="moment_based")`, efficient metamodel selection, and `voiage calculate-evsi`.
*   [x] Default calibration VOI to the built-in modeler.
    *   Made `voi_calibration` usable without a custom modeler by defaulting to the existing built-in calibration modeler.
*   [x] Add a built-in observational VOI modeler.
    *   Added a default observational modeler for explicit net-benefit or cost/effect PSA samples with sample-size and bias-strength uncertainty adjustment.
*   [x] Replace the JAX two-loop EVSI placeholder.
    *   Implemented a JAX-assisted posterior update and resampling path and added a regression test proving the NumPy fallback is not used.
*   [x] Replace the sequential VOI step-level EVPI placeholder.
    *   Implemented the standard EVPI formula for explicit net-benefit samples and added regression tests for payoff extraction, monotonic learning behavior, and resolved-uncertainty cases.
*   [x] Enforce 90% branch-aware Python coverage.
    *   Enabled branch coverage in the active coverage configuration and added targeted tests across schema, backend, structural VOI, config, financial-risk, healthcare, memory-optimization, and network meta-analysis paths.
*   [x] Scaffold polyglot binding package CI and release publishing.
    *   Added TypeScript/npm, Go module, Rust/crates.io, Julia, .NET 11/NuGet, and R package validation paths.

*   [x] Add a stable core API result schema and example for CEAC outputs.
    *   Added the CEAC result schema, versioned example payload, and validator coverage.
*   [x] Stabilize the curated package export surface for `voiage.core`, `voiage.methods`, and `voiage.plot`.
    *   Replaced placeholder subpackage entrypoints with explicit re-exports and added regression coverage to lock in the package-level import surface.
*   [x] Stabilize the top-level `voiage` package export surface.
    *   Added a root package facade that re-exports the primary submodules and locked it in with regression coverage.
