## Verification Commands

- [ ] `uv run pytest tests/test_conductor_followthrough_tracks.py --no-cov`
- [ ] `uv run --with tox tox -e lint,typecheck,docs,py314,coverage_report,frontier-contract,version-sync`
- [ ] Rust and binding language-native gates when kernels or adapters change

## Evidence update 2026-07-16

- Added the Python `value_of_dynamic_real_options` runtime and
  `DynamicRealOptionsResult` envelope with stage weighting, discounting,
  irreversibility and lock-in penalties, option/waiting value, policy regret,
  robust strategy, Pareto strategies, diagnostics, and CHEERS-VOI reporting.
- Added the `calculate-dynamic-real-options` CLI command and curated exports.
- Promoted the schema/examples from planned to fixture-backed maturity and
  added hash-pinned evidence validation.
- Commit ``5568083`` records the runtime, CLI, fixture, and evidence
  checkpoint with its Conductor review note.
- Full local verification passed: Ruff/format, 1226 tests with 10 skips,
  coverage above 90%, Astro docs, typecheck, frontier-contract, and
  version-sync gates.
- Real longitudinal data, Rust/cross-language parity, and mature/stable
  approval remain explicit gates; no stable claim is made.

## Archive closeout 2026-07-17

- Hosted PR #165 merged as ``067d8a5`` with all required checks and Python
  CodeQL analysis passing; the maximal-quality ruleset was restored active.
- Archived after completing the repository-owned runtime, CLI, fixture, and
  evidence slice. Longitudinal data, parity, and mature approval remain
  explicit external gates.
