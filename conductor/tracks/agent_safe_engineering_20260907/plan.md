# Plan: Agent-safe engineering improvements

G01–G08 repository-owned slices are complete from their accepted delivery evidence. Repository allocation precedes implementation;
[repository-boundaries.md](./repository-boundaries.md) orders the separate
integration pilots and defines the external capabilities excluded from this repo. Follow [worker-guide.md](./worker-guide.md). A package is not an atomic implementation task: finish its bounded design packet before implementation.

## G01: Execution packets and drift enforcement

Implementation authority is delegated to [execution_packet_guard](../execution_packet_guard_20260907/index.md).
The following parent tasks are tracking summaries only; do not execute duplicate work.

Prerequisites: none; planning preflight is ready.

- [x] G01.1 — Confirm repository allocations and exclusions in repository-boundaries.md, inspect conductor-next reuse, and freeze the Voiage-specific validator profile; read the packet inputs; verify the observed gap against HEAD, identify one bounded change and freeze the exact files, baseline hashes, acceptance fixture and toolchain. Record existing behavior and intended failure (G01-AC).
- [x] G01.2 — Write and run the negative/analytic witness first; implement the frozen slice only after prerequisites and integrator review are recorded. Run `python -m pytest tests/test_execution_packets.py tests/test_repo_harness.py -q` plus affected checks (G01-AC).
- [x] G01.3 — Review the diff against the packet; run required final gates, bind evidence to source and environment, and update plan/metadata only for proven completion (G01-AC).

## G02: Rust dependency and feature qualification

Prerequisites: G01. The bounded qualification matrix is frozen in [dependency-feature-matrix.json](./dependency-feature-matrix.json); runtime/dependency promotion is complete; optional telemetry remains separately gated.

- [x] G02.1 — Read the packet inputs; verify the observed gap against HEAD, identify one bounded change and freeze the exact files, baseline hashes, acceptance fixture and toolchain. Record existing behavior and intended failure (G02-AC).
- [x] G02.2 — Write and run the negative/analytic witness first; implement the frozen slice only after prerequisites and integrator review are recorded. Run `python -m pytest tests/test_dependency_promotion_policy.py tests/test_dependency_frontier_script.py -q` plus affected checks (G02-AC).
- [x] G02.3 — Review the diff against the packet; bind hosted compatibility-and-coverage and all required PR checks to the exact source tree, record the local cold-cache timeout as an environmental limitation, and reconcile plan metadata (G02-AC).

## G03: Voiage compatibility and replaceable providers

Version identity/evolution implementation follows [version_identity_contracts](../version_identity_contracts_20260907/index.md).
Use [orchestration.md](./orchestration.md) to exclude transferred logging/pilot work from G06–G08.

Prerequisites: G01.

- [x] G03.1 — Read the packet inputs; froze the compatibility witness scope and baseline evidence (G03-AC).
- [x] G03.2 — Added independent C consumer and provider semantic/interchange witnesses; focused consumer and sanitizer contracts passed (G03-AC).
- [x] G03.3 — Reviewed and merged as PR #1175 (`90a254db`), following witness PR #1170; hosted required checks passed (G03-AC).

## G04: CI cost and failure reproducibility

Prerequisites: G01.

- [x] G04.1 — Read the packet inputs; froze the exact measurement/test subset, baseline hashes, acceptance fixture and toolchain; the missing measurement packet is the recorded negative witness (G04-AC).
- [x] G04.2 — Added the CI measurement contract and fail-closed policy assertions; `uv run pytest tests/test_exact_head_workflows.py tests/test_repo_harness.py -q` passes (15 tests) (G04-AC).
- [x] G04.3 — Review the diff against the packet; run required final gates, bind evidence to source and environment, and update plan/metadata only for proven completion (G04-AC). PR #1164 merged as `184a3299b1d1a54a33c79bc5eb5545b7cfee3520`; exact-head hosted checks passed.

## G05: Numerical adversarial assurance

Prerequisites: G01.

- [x] G05.1 — Froze the EVPI affine-invariance/extreme-scale case register, exact Rust source subset, baseline hashes and toolchain; absent register is the negative witness (G05-AC).
- [x] G05.2 — Added the large-magnitude analytic EVPI witness and case register; `cargo test --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --locked -p voiage-numerics -p voiage-test-support` passes, including live case-register validation (G05-AC).
- [x] G05.3 — Review the diff against the packet; run required final gates, bind evidence to source and environment, and update plan/metadata only for proven completion (G05-AC). PR #1165 merged; exact-head hosted checks passed and the numerical register witness is recorded.

- [~] G05.4 — Correct the prior live-target claim: the original register test
  checked target syntax only. The numerical test binary now enumerates its
  compiled, non-ignored cases and accepts exactly one active or archived
  register; retain package-level, clean-package, full-local and current-head
  hosted evidence before marking this review fix complete.

## G06: Bounded jobs and recoverable computation

Prerequisites: G01.

- [x] G06.1 — Read the packet inputs; verify the observed gap against HEAD, identify one bounded change and freeze the exact files, baseline hashes, acceptance fixture and toolchain. Record existing behavior and intended failure (G06-AC).
- [x] G06.2 — Write and run the negative/analytic witness first; implement the frozen slice only after prerequisites and integrator review are recorded. Run `cargo test --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --locked -p voiage-domain -p voiage-diagnostics -p voiage-numerics` plus affected checks (G06-AC).
- [x] G06.3 — Reviewed and merged deterministic replay and CPU-tolerance evidence as PR #1174 (`819888ca`), following persistence PR #1171; hosted required checks passed (G06-AC).

## G07: Capability discovery and reproducible user reports

Prerequisites: G01, G03.

- [x] G07.1 — Selected the Voiage CLI capability-report contract, froze the exact scope and readiness evidence in `g07-readiness.json`, and recorded the negative witness (G07-AC).
- [x] G07.2 — Added schema-bound dry-run reports and actionable fail-closed diagnostics; the focused capability/consumer/docs checks passed on the exact PR head (G07-AC).
- [x] G07.3 — Reviewed and merged as PR #1172 (`a4b5ddb0`); hosted required checks passed and sensitive-field exclusions remain explicit (G07-AC).

## G08: Automation and release evidence lifecycle

Prerequisites: G01, G02, G04.

- [x] G08.1 — Froze the candidate scope, baseline hashes, absent-policy witness, locked toolchain, and ownership in `g08-readiness.json` (G08-AC).
- [x] G08.2 — Added fail-closed automation and release-evidence transition guards; the focused release/dependency tests passed with 29 tests (G08-AC).
- [x] G08.3 — Reviewed and merged as PR #1168 (`d4fc3bac`); hosted required checks passed and publication remains an external gate (G08-AC).
