## Verification Commands

- [ ] `uv run pytest tests/test_conductor_followthrough_tracks.py --no-cov`
- [ ] `uv run --with tox tox -e lint,typecheck,docs,py314,coverage_report,frontier-contract,version-sync`
- [ ] Rust and binding language-native gates when kernels or adapters change

## Evidence update 2026-07-16

- Existing runtime, result envelope, CLI, docs, and two-perspective deterministic
  fixture were audited as repository-owned implementation.
- Added the seven-perspective stakeholder catalog and hash-pinned evidence
  manifest in ``specs/frontier/perspective/v1/fixtures``.
- Commit ``4fc614d`` records this contract-boundary checkpoint and its review
  note.
- The real-data gate remains explicit: no committed dataset currently supports
  defensible payer, societal, patient, provider, regulator, and equity-weighted
  transforms from the same outcome/cost basis.
- Cross-language parity, Rust parity review, real-data attribution, and mature
  approval remain open; the method stays fixture-backed.
