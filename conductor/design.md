    participant V as VOIAGE method
    participant F as Fingerprint
    participant W as Arrow writer
    participant X as Fresh-process consumer
    participant T as Hosted tests

    V->>F: Describe ordered logical fields
    F->>F: Hash canonical JSON
    V->>W: Add shared contract metadata
    W->>X: IPC or Parquet artifact
    X->>T: Values, types, metadata and fingerprint
    T-->>V: Pass or fail closed

The archived Conductor registry documents historical implementation. GitHub
issues and the shared project provide the public ledger; local specifications,
fixtures, and CI evidence remain authoritative for technical completion.
