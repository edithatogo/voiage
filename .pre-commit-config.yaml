        exclude: ^tests/



# Tox: Optional, for running tox environments (e.g., tests) via pre-commit
# This can be slow, so often run manually or in CI.
# -   repo: local
#     hooks:
#       - id: tox
#         name: tox (run test environments)
#         entry: tox

# tox-ini-fmt: Formatter for tox.ini file
-   repo: https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-ini-fmt

# Pygrep hooks for various Python-specific checks

    rev: v1.10.0
    hooks:

    # -   id: python-check-mock-methods # Useful if using `unittest.mock`.
    -   id: python-no-eval # Checks for `eval()`.
    -   id: python-no-log-warn # Discourages `logging.warn` (use `logging.warning`).
    # -   id: python-use-type-annotations # Enforces type annotations (Ruff's ANN rules are more comprehensive).
    # -   id: text-unicode-replacement-char # Checks for the unicode replacement character.

# Sort pyproject.toml (optional, but good for consistency)
# -   repo: https://github.com/abravalheri/toml-sort
#     rev: vX.Y.Z # Check latest version
#     hooks:
#       - id: toml-sort
#         args: ["pyproject.toml"]

# Note on Hypothesis:
# Hypothesis tests are typically run as part of your pytest suite.
# There isn't a separate pre-commit hook for Hypothesis itself; its execution
# would be covered if `tox` or `pytest` is run via pre-commit.

# Ensure files are UTF-8 (already covered by pre-commit-hooks' end-of-file-fixer and trailing-whitespace implicitly)
# but this hook is more explicit if needed for other file types.
# -   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pygrep-hooks # (already listed)
#     rev: v1.10.0
#     hooks:
#     -   id: text-unicode-replacement-char # Checks for the unicode replacement character in text files.

# To install the hooks: pre-commit install
# To run on all files: pre-commit run --all-files
# To run on staged files (what happens on commit): pre-commit run
# (or just `git commit` if hooks are installed)
