`voiage` is a Python library for Value of Information (VOI) analysis, designed to provide a comprehensive, open-source toolkit for researchers and decision-makers.

## Background: The Need for a Comprehensive VOI Tool in Python

Value of Information (VOI) analysis is a powerful set of techniques used to estimate the value of collecting additional data to reduce uncertainty in decision-making. While several tools for VOI analysis exist, the current landscape has some significant gaps:

*   **Limited Python Support:** The Python ecosystem lacks a mature, comprehensive VOI library. Most existing tools are written in R or are commercial, closed-source products.
*   **Fragmented Features:** Existing tools, even in the R ecosystem, are fragmented. Different packages support different VOI methods, and none of them offer a complete toolkit.
*   **Lack of Advanced Methods:** Many advanced and specialized VOI methods, such as those for adaptive trial designs, network meta-analyses, or structural uncertainty, are not available in any off-the-shelf tool.

`voiage` aims to fill these gaps by providing a single, powerful, and easy-to-use library for a wide range of VOI analyses in Python.

## Feature Comparison

The following table compares the features of `voiage` with other common VOI software.

## Installation

You can install `voiage` via pip:

```bash
pip install voiage
```

## Getting Started

Here's a simple example of how to use `voiage` to calculate the EVPI:

```python
import numpy as np
from voiage.analysis import evpi

# Your model inputs and outputs
psa_inputs = {
    'param1': np.random.rand(1000),
    'param2': np.random.rand(1000),
}
psa_outputs = np.random.rand(1000, 2) # 1000 simulations, 2 strategies

# Calculate the EVPI
evpi_value = evpi(psa_inputs, psa_outputs)
print(f"EVPI: {evpi_value}")
```
