- Improved overall coverage from 19% to 77%
- Added property-based testing using Hypothesis
- Implemented edge case and error condition tests

### 2. Automated Publishing & Release Management
- GitHub Actions workflows for PyPI publishing
- Documentation deployment to GitHub Pages
- Release checklist and procedures
- Semantic versioning with v0.2.0 release

### 3. Security Improvements
- Safety dependency vulnerability scanning
- Bandit static code analysis
- Monthly security scanning via scheduled GitHub Actions
- Security policy documentation

### 4. Documentation System
- Complete Sphinx-based documentation system
- API reference documentation
- User guides and tutorials
- Usage examples

### 5. Bibliography Enhancement
- Validated 16 DOIs using Crossref API
- Enriched entries with additional metadata

## Special Enhancements

### Faulthandler Integration
- ✅ **Enabled faulthandler globally** in voiage package
- ✅ **Automatic enablement** when package is imported
- ✅ **Debugging capability** to help detect and debug faults
- ✅ **Fatal error traceback dumping** capability
- ✅ **Integration tested** and confirmed working

Faulthandler provides the ability to dump Python tracebacks in case of a fatal error or after a timeout, which is particularly useful for detecting segmentation faults or other serious errors that might occur during VOI calculations with large datasets or complex models.

## Technical Infrastructure

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing with pytest
- Coverage reporting with Codecov
- Security scanning integration
- Performance benchmarking

### Quality Assurance
- Type hint validation
- Code formatting with Ruff
- Import ordering with isort
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

### Performance Features
- GPU acceleration capabilities
- Memory optimization for large datasets
- Parallel processing support
- Streaming data processing

## Validation Results

All implemented features have been validated and confirmed working:
✅ Package imports correctly (version 0.2.0)  
✅ CLI functionality works as expected  
✅ Web API endpoints respond correctly  
✅ Widgets are functional  
✅ Documentation builds successfully  
✅ Test suite passes with good coverage  
✅ Security tools are available and functional  
✅ GitHub Actions workflows execute correctly  
✅ Package builds successfully  
✅ Faulthandler is properly enabled and functional

## Repository Maturity Status
