- ✅ Security scanning integrated at multiple levels
- ✅ Release management automation

## Key Technical Achievements

1. **Dependency Security Scanning**: Integrated `safety` tool for checking known vulnerabilities in dependencies
2. **Automated Release Management**: Created `.github/workflows/publish.yml` for automated PyPI releases
3. **Documentation Automation**: Created `.github/workflows/docs.yml` for automated documentation deployment
4. **Security Analysis Automation**: Created `.github/workflows/security.yml` for automated security scanning
5. **Comprehensive Security Documentation**: Created `SECURITY.md` with security policy and best practices
6. **Code Coverage Configuration**: Created `codecov.yml` for code coverage reporting and thresholds
7. **Release Process Standardization**: Created `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` for standardized release procedures

## Future Recommendations

1. **Continued Maintenance**: Regular dependency updates and security scanning
2. **Community Engagement**: Encourage contributions through clear guidelines
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track and optimize computational efficiency
4. **Extended Validation**: Compare results with established R packages
5. **Documentation Expansion**: Add more tutorials and examples

This implementation transforms voiage from a basic VOI toolkit into a comprehensive, enterprise-grade solution for Value of Information analysis in Python, filling a critical gap in the ecosystem for health economics and decision analysis.
