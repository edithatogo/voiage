# Example Images (Placeholders)

This directory contains placeholder image files to demonstrate where visual examples would be located.

These images are not actual plots generated by the `voiage` library but serve as visual representations for documentation and presentation purposes.

Once the plotting functionalities are implemented, these placeholders should be replaced with actual generated plots.

- `ceac_curve_placeholder.png`: Represents a Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curve.
- `voi_curve_placeholder.png`: Represents a Value of Information Curve.
- `evppi_surface_placeholder.png`: Represents an Expected Value of Partial Perfect Information Surface.
