"""Validation tests for CI/CD quality gates configuration.

This module validates that the CI/CD quality gates are properly configured
according to the strict CI/CD quality gates policy, including:
- Linting and formatting gates
- Type checking gates
- Coverage thresholds
- Property-based testing
- Mutation testing
- Security checks
- Documentation builds
- Binding language-native gates
